  Conventional and regression-based continuous norming methods for
  psychometric,  biometric and medical test construction. Percentiles and norm
  scores are estimated  via inverse normal transformation and modeled via Taylor
  polynomials. The continuous method reduces the necessary sample size, closes
  gaps between and within the norm groups and decreases error variance in the
  norm data.
