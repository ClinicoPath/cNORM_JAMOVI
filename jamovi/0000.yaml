  The module provides methods  for norming in the context of psychometrics,
  biometrics, medical screenings... It features both conventional as well as
  continuous norming methods for the estimation of percentiles and norm scores
  via inverse normal transformation and regression via Taylor polynomials. The
  continuous method  reduces the necessary sample size, close gaps between and
  within the groups and increase norm score reliability. It does not require 
  specific distribution assumptions for the data. Further information:
