Description: The module provides methods  for norming in the context of psychometrics, biometrics, medical screenings...
    It features both conventional as well as continuous norming methods for the estimation of percentiles and norm scores via
    inverse normal transformation (conventional) and regression via Taylor polynomials (Continuous norming). The continuous method 
    reduces the necessary sample size, close gaps between and within the groups and increase norm score reliability. It does not require 
    specific distribution assumptions for the data. Further information: https://www.psychometrica.de/cNorm_en.html
