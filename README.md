# cNORM_JAMOVI
JAMOVI Frontend for Continuous Norming with cNORM. Please use the module library of JAMOVI to install the module.

## Functions:
Includes conventional and regression-based continuous norming methods for psychometric, 
biometric and medical test construction. Percentiles and norm scores are estimated 
via inverse normal transformation and modeled via Taylor polynomials. The
continuous method reduces the necessary sample size, closes gaps between and
within the norm groups and decreases error variance in the norm data.

Tutorials on conducting the method and the statistical background is available via https://www.psychometrica.de/cNorm_en.html
